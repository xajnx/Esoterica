 🛠 First-Steps Roadmap for Esoterica AI
Phase 1 – Foundations

✅ Goal: Get the scaffolding up and running so Miryana can “speak”

Create a new GitHub repo (esoterica-ai)

Drop in these files:

persona.md

Esoterica_Create_Prompt_Updated

Esoterica_Iterative_Dev_Updated

README.md

Use the Create Prompt in VSCode’s Chat to bootstrap the project (backend + frontend scaffold).

Run the backend locally (uvicorn app:app --reload) and frontend (npm run dev) to confirm you can type into a chatbox and get any response back.

Phase 2 – Give Miryana a Voice

✅ Goal: Miryana is more than boilerplate; she has a personality.

Hard-code Miryana’s intro message (from persona.md) so it appears when the UI loads.

Add a config file that always prepends Miryana’s persona instructions to the model’s system prompt.

Test by asking simple questions like:

“Who are you?”

“Show me a parallel between Genesis and Enuma Elish.”

Phase 3 – Build Knowledge

✅ Goal: Let Miryana “study” instead of only repeating model memory.

Collect sample texts to seed her (start small):

Genesis 1–3 (Bible)

Enuma Elish (Babylonian)

Rig Veda Hymn of Creation (Vedic)

Egyptian Pyramid Texts (short excerpt)

Write a data ingestion script that chunks these texts and stores them in FAISS (vector database).

Update backend /chat to first query FAISS → then pass top chunks + persona to the model.

Now Miryana can ground her responses in actual texts instead of just “model memory.”

Phase 4 – Expand & Polish

✅ Goal: Grow scope and improve experience.

Add more corpora gradually (Torah, Quran, Sutras, etc.).

Improve frontend:

Persona avatar (stylized prophetess icon).

Toggle for “Quick Summary” vs “Deep Dive.”

Loading animation like a “scroll unrolling.”

Add logging → so you can track what texts Miryana used to answer.

Invite trusted friends to test and give feedback.

Phase 5 – Dream Big

✅ Goal: Scale toward your full vision.

Multi-language support.

Comparative timelines of traditions (interactive).

“Harmonic Map” → visualize parallels across religions.

Deploy live (e.g., on Vercel + Railway).

🧭 Mindset Check

Don’t try to train an AI from scratch (not needed). You’ll leverage existing models + ground them with curated texts.

Scope small at first: one Bible chapter + one other text → then grow outward.

Persona is your north star: everything funnels through Miryana’s voice.
