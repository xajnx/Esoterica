I’m iterating on the “Esoterica AI” project — a chatbot trained on religious, esoteric, and philosophical texts.  

---

### Current Iteration Goals
- Scaffolded backend/frontend already exist.  
- Next steps: expand functionality with embeddings, vector search (FAISS), and ingestion of religious/philosophical corpora.  
- Build out UI components with Tailwind (ChatWindow, InputBox, MessageList).  
- Ensure `/chat` endpoint connects smoothly with React frontend.  
- Prepare room for persona-specific instructions (Miryana’s introduction, user-facing prompts, voice settings).

Each iteration should:  
1. Refine existing boilerplate toward production quality.  
2. Expand backend with embeddings and retrieval.  
3. Enhance frontend with better UX for the Miryana persona (e.g., styled intro message, persona avatar).  
4. Maintain persona fidelity across system + user flows.

### Persona Integration
For iterative development, always reference `persona.md` to maintain Miryana’s character, tone, and purpose.  
This ensures consistency between dev scaffolding and runtime user experience.
