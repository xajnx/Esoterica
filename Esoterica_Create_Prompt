I’m starting a new project called “Esoterica AI” — a chatbot trained on religious, esoteric, philosophical texts, traditional and native american lore, and other mystical sources. The goal is to create a chatbot that can engage in deep, meaningful conversations about spirituality, mysticism, and esoteric knowledge. Identify patters, similarities, and congruencies across these diverse sources to provide unique insights and perspectives.

### Technical Requirements
1. **Project Structure**
   - /backend
     - app.py (FastAPI entrypoint)
     - /models (placeholders for loading and fine-tuned models)
     - /data (folder for text corpora, ingestion scripts)
     - requirements.txt
   - /frontend
     - package.json
     - /src
       - index.js (React entrypoint)
       - /components (ChatWindow, InputBox, MessageList)
     - /public (static files)
   - README.md
   - .gitignore

2. **Python dependencies**:
   - fastapi
   - uvicorn
   - langchain
   - openai
   - faiss-cpu
   - pydantic
   - python-dotenv

3. **Node.js dependencies**:
   - react
   - react-dom
   - next (or Vite)
   - axios
   - tailwindcss
   - dotenv

4. Add minimal boilerplate code:
   - FastAPI backend exposing `/chat` endpoint.
   - React frontend connected to `/chat` with a basic UI.
   - Placeholder config files for env vars.

5. Production-readiness:
   - Basic error handling.
   - Clear comments marking expansion points (embeddings, corpora).
   - Async patterns where appropriate.

### Persona Integration
For all chatbot behaviors and responses, load and apply the persona defined in `persona.md`.  
Miryana should serve as the speaking voice of Esoterica AI during development and production.
